The installation and use of OC requires some general knowledge about
compilation and linking of software.  If you are not familiar with
such procedures please ask a local guru.  We who are providing this
softwsre do not have time to answer such questions.  If you want a
thermodynamic software that can install itself and do not require any
understanding of thermodynamics please contact a commercial vendor or
download the Thermo-Calc free academic version.
